**Introduction**

Attracting and retaining top talent can be like trying to find a needle in a haystack—or more accurately, like finding the perfect avocado at the grocery store. Even when the candidate pool is big and hungry, it can still be a challenge.

Guess what? It's not just you. A recent report found that 77% of employers worldwide are struggling to fill open roles, hitting a 17-year high. Apparently, IT and related fields are having the hardest time. Why? Well, there are plenty of talented folks out there, but finding workers with the right combo of advanced tech skills and those all-important soft skills is like trying to assemble IKEA furniture without instructions. The struggle is real in other industries too, including finance.

If you’re having a tough time filling roles, maybe it's time to take a step back and assess the situation before you throw more money into the recruitment abyss. Several factors might be contributing to the issue, and understanding them is your first step toward making your company the ultimate dream job destination.

**Your Reputation Precedes You**

First up, are you building an employer brand that’s spotless? Thanks to platforms like Glassdoor and LinkedIn, prospective employees can easily research what current and former employees think of your company. Spoiler alert: A history of negative reviews and management complaints are like waving red flags.

Leadership at many companies often underestimate the power of employee reviews. According to a CareerArc survey of over 1,000 people, 91% of candidates seek out at least one online or offline resource to evaluate an employer’s brand before applying for a job. Less than a quarter (21%) would apply to a 1-star company, and two-thirds (34%) wouldn’t touch a 2-star company with a ten-foot pole.

Stay on top of your reviews and respond to both the good and the bad. Address complaints without getting defensive or argumentative, and thank people for saying nice things. Take feedback seriously, be honest about where improvement is needed, and make the necessary changes.

Your candidate and employee experiences also play a big role in your branding. If people feel slighted, disrespected, or insulted at any touchpoint in the candidate journey, they probably won’t stop at writing a bad review—they'll likely tell their friends, their grandma, and their dog too.

Meanwhile, not having an employer brand can be just as bad as having a bad one. If potential employees can’t find any info about your company, they’re less likely to apply. Investing in employer branding through social media, company websites, and career fairs can increase your visibility and attract more candidates.

**Frustrating Hiring Processes Send People Into the Arms of Competitors**

The hiring process can be bumpier than a gravel road, but we should aim to make it as smooth as a freshly paved highway. This means comprehensive and clear job descriptions, respectful interactions, and streamlined processes. It all starts with knowing what you’re looking for in an employee and your plan for finding it, and it continues throughout the journey.

Excessive time to hire is a major factor. You want to make the right choice, but people don’t want to sit around waiting forever, and yours is probably not the only role they’ve applied for. Long wait times and endless interview rounds will result in candidates losing interest faster than ice cream melting in the sun. If your process involves six interviews and takes seven weeks, and someone else swoops in and grabs your candidate in three, you’re going to lose them, even if you’re their top choice. Finding ways to speed up your time to hire can go a long way.

Being respectful of people and their time will improve your relationships with candidates and your recruitment processes.

**Poor Compensation and Benefits**

If your salaries, bonuses, and benefits don’t match or exceed industry standards, potential candidates will look elsewhere. Remember, it’s not just about the paycheck; health benefits, retirement plans, and other perks matter too. Pay people the best you can and be as upfront as possible about it. If someone is asking for a specific number and your best offer is nowhere near that, don’t waste their time with six interview rounds only to make an offer they won’t accept.

Addressing these issues requires strategy and a commitment to change. Improving your company’s reputation, offering competitive compensation, and fostering a positive hiring experience are crucial steps. Taking action to make your company a more desirable place to work can help you attract the people you need to drive your business forward.

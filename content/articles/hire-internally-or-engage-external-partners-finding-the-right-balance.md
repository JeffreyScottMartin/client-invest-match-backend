**Hire Internally or Engage External Partners? Finding the Right Balance**

Growing businesses face a tough choice. Should you hire new people in-house or work with external partners to get things done? Hiring internally gives you control and continuity, but it can be costly and slow. External partners can bring expertise, fresh ideas, and flexibility, but only if you choose wisely.

**Why the Choice Matters**

Business moves quickly and companies need to adapt. You want to invest in your team while staying flexible enough to bring in outside help when it makes sense.  AI is causing leaders to pause and consider the future of different business functions and areas.  

**Finding the Right Balance**

Invest in Your Core Team: Build internal capabilities where deep knowledge is critical. Reducing professional development or team investment can save money in the short term but hurt long-term growth.

Bring in Partners for Specialized Work.For areas requiring specific skills or faster results, external experts can help your company move forward more efficiently.

Plan Before You Decide: This is the most important step.  Pause and clearly define your goals and project scope. Understanding what success looks like will help you decide where to hire internally and where to work with external partners.  

**A Framework for Gauging Internal Capability**

Managers can use the following approach to assess whether their team can handle a project or if they need outside help:

1. **Define Objectives:** Clearly outline what the project or function needs to achieve. Specify outcomes, timelines, and success measures.

2. **Inventory Skills:** List the skills and experience your team currently has. Identify gaps in knowledge, expertise, or capacity.

3. **Assess Bandwidth:** Evaluate whether current staff can handle the workload along with their existing responsibilities without compromising quality.

4. **Prioritize Critical Work:** Determine which tasks are core to your business and should stay in-house, and which can be supported or accelerated by external partners.

5. **Measure Impact:** Look beyond team size. Focus on what results are needed, how efficiency can improve, and what drives growth rather than counting heads.

6. **Pilot and Adjust:** Test external partnerships on smaller projects first. Evaluate results and learn from the experience before making long-term commitments.

**Why External Partners Can Help**

They provide flexibility to scale up or down without long-term commitments.
They bring expertise and practical experience your team may not have.
They can implement solutions quickly.
They introduce new ideas and ways of working that can improve results.
